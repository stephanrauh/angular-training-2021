# Introduction

## Introducing Stephan

I'm Stephan. I'm going to tell you something about Angular. I've been following the Angular story for quite some time. My first blog about Angular dates back to 2014. Fun fact: I've never worked on a large Angular project. But I've been working during the early stages of quite a few Angular projects that are large Angular projects now. Plus, my blog is an Angular application, and I maintain a very successful library for Angular (ngx-extended-pdf-viewer).

In other words: I'm sure there are people who are more expert in all things Angular. But I definetely know what I'm talking about, and I benefit from a much broader view. Ask me about cloud computing, Java Server Faces, Vue.js, React.js, GraalVM, Quarkus, CDI, or even Spring, and I'm going to answer competently. But of course, you can ask me about Angular. 

## Introducing you

Now it's your turn. Who are you? Are you are Java / JavaScript / Python / PHP / C# / FOTRAN programmer? What are your expectations regarding this course?
