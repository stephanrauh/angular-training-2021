# Introduction

## Introducing Stephan

I'm Stephan. I'm going to tell you something about Angular. I've been following the Angular story for quite some time. My first blog about Angular dates back to 2014. My blog is an Angular application, and I maintain a very successful library for Angular (ngx-extended-pdf-viewer). But I spend most of my working hours are working on other technologies.

In other words: I'm sure there are people who are more expert in all things Angular. But I definetely know what I'm talking about, and I benefit from a much broader view. Ask me about cloud computing, Java Server Faces, Vue.js, React.js, GraalVM, Quarkus, CDI, or even Spring, and I'm going to answer competently. Oh, and you can even ask me about Angular.

## Introducing you
